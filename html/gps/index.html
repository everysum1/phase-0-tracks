 **What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

 Semantic tags are to break up code into meaningful sections in order to more easily distinguish or give importance to certain sections of html content.  I feel some of the most useful semantic tags are nav, main, header and footer.  

**What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser reads html files from top to bottom, left to right and renders things in that order

**What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned about making snippets and building in boilerplate code into my text editor so if I find myself repeating the same code again and again I can automate it in sublime now.  I will definitely use this at a later date when I find myself doing this. 

**What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

I didn't find any concept particularly difficult.  I guess I would say positioning since I haven't fully memorized what everything does in order to position elements in terms of the float attribute, but I feel like as I try to challenge myself to do things and I look them up and am able to implement them in a solution, I learn things more solidly and cohesively.
