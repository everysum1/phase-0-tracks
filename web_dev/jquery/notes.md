I plan to approach my discovery of jquery by first starting with the documentation and coming up with questions I have about jquery from what I already know about it or have heard of, and also what I'm curious about in terms of actually learning jquery myself.  Then I will spend some time looking at the answers to these questions in search results, probably mostly stack overflow and maybe then watch a video or two about jquery if I can find one that looks interesting on youtube.  



I felt that just looking at things I was curious about was most effective because that not only started answering my questions so I can fully grasp what is possible in jquery, it also allowed me to look at related questions and allowed me to discover the topic breadthwise.
